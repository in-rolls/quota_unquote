# Data dictionary

One row in each analysis-ready file is one election GP observed against one PAI version. The left table always remains the election panel, so each file has two rows per election GP even when no PAI record links. Rajasthan contains the 2015 to 2020 panel. UP contains the canonical 2021 winners imported from `local_elections_up`.

## PAI theme 8 indicators

`docs/pai_theme8_indicators.csv` lists every indicator behind the Good Governance theme for
both PAI versions, as fetched from the portal's indicator browser by
`scripts/00c_pai_theme8_indicators.py`. The script and `tests/test_pai_indicators.py`
assert the contract below on every run: one row per (`pai_version`, `indicator_id`), no
missing values, 62 PAI 1.0 and 26 PAI 2.0 rows, exactly 10 indicator ids shared.

| name | type | unit | values | uniqueness | provenance |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pai_version` | string | indicator | `PAI 1.0`, `PAI 2.0` | part of the key | portal query `s=1` or `s=2` |
| `fiscal_year` | string | indicator | `2022-2023`, `2023-2024` | constant within version | PAI release year |
| `indicator_id` | int64 | indicator | portal indicator id | key with `pai_version`; the portal repeats an id under alias wordings and only the first is kept | bracketed suffix of the indicator label |
| `mandatory` | string | indicator | `Mandatory`, `Optional` | none | portal column |
| `kind` | string | indicator | `ratio` (denominator distinct from numerator), `binary` (yes/no check) | none | derived by `classify()` |
| `indicator` | string | indicator | indicator label without its id | non-empty | portal column |
| `numerator` | string | indicator | data point label | non-empty | portal column |
| `denominator` | string | indicator | data point label; empty for yes/no checks | non-empty when `kind` is `ratio` | portal column |
| `source_url` | string | indicator | portal page fetched | constant within version | script |
| `retrieved_utc` | string | indicator | ISO 8601 UTC timestamp | non-empty | script |

## Open questions

- The 2020 reservation allocation frame and fixed treatment counts within each district, Panchayat Samiti, and caste category still require an official source.
- PAI release v0.2.0 carries LGD GP codes for both vintages. The 77 reviewed nonexact district-block mappings now serve only Rajasthan rows without an LGD code; `pai2_group_mapping_audit.csv` records the supporting counts and GP-name overlaps.
- Rajasthan GP fuzzy-link precision and recall remain unknown until a stratified clerical sample is labeled.
- The UP election-to-LGD accepted threshold has 75 accepted-band links checked by hand, all judged matches. Lower-scoring proposals remain outside the active crosswalk.
- PAI score missingness in the joined file currently means failed record linkage, not a portal score of zero.

## Join contract

Linkage follows the precision-first rules of [`preclink`](https://github.com/finite-sample/preclink)
and the `quota` replication: exact normalized composite keys within a geographic block, one
election row to at most one PAI row, keys that are ambiguous on either side dropped rather
than adjudicated, doubtful links (a code whose PAI name is not the LGD name) dropped rather
than kept, and fuzzy proposals confined to a robustness variant. Every dropped or unmatched
row is written to an audit file, and a failed link is missing, never zero.

### Rajasthan PAI 1.0

The left table is the 7,882-row Rajasthan election panel, keyed uniquely by
`election_gp_key`. PAI Theme 8 is unique by `gp_code`. The many-to-one direct LGD-code
join must preserve all 7,882 election rows; missing LGD codes remain unmatched.

### Rajasthan PAI 2.0 geography

Panel rows with an LGD GP code join PAI 2.0 directly on that code (4,704 of 7,882). For the
rest, the pipeline first joins normalized district-block groups exactly. Nonexact groups require
an approved row in `pai2_group_overrides.csv`. The active list contains 77 source groups
affected by spelling or Rajasthan's district reorganization. Review excluded treatment and
outcome fields. Each target must exist in PAI, each left group must be unique, and ambiguous
statewide block names require explicit evidence.

Within approved groups, exact normalized official GP names are tried first, followed by exact
normalized election names. Preclink Jaro-Winkler scores, a 0.85 threshold, a 0.05 margin, and
Hungarian assignment produce proposals only. Since PAI carries LGD codes, a reviewed fuzzy
link is excluded from the primary sample and could only feed a robustness variant; the
analysis also reports a variant restricted to direct-code links. Accepted links are one to
one and unmatched outcomes remain missing.

### Uttar Pradesh election and PAI joins

The canonical `local_elections_up` release supplies exactly 49,773 2021 GP winner rows.
This repository imports its names, reservation recodes, LGD links, and collision flags rather
than maintaining parallel overrides.

Both waves join accepted election-to-LGD GP codes directly, keeping a code link only when
the PAI GP name equals the LGD GP name after normalization; the 3 UP conflicts are listed in
`up_pai_code_name_conflicts.csv` and left unmatched. Rows without a code then try
exact normalized official GP names within district and LGD block, then exact normalized
election GP names among unused rows; on PAI release v0.2.0 these passes add no links.
Accepted links must be one to one. Each wave preserves all 49,773 election rows,
and the stacked file must contain exactly 99,546 rows.

### Required diagnostics

- Row counts before and after every join.
- Key uniqueness on the required side.
- Match rates overall and by reservation status.
- Linked GPs and informative assignment strata by PAI version.
- No reuse of accepted PAI 2.0 rows.
- Unmatched examples from both sides.
- Precision and recall from a hand-labeled sample stratified by score and margin.

## Recode contract

| variable | definition | required check |
|---|---|---|
| `an_women_reserved` (Rajasthan) | 1 for a women-reserved 2020 sarpanch seat; 0 for an open-gender category | observed values are exactly 0 and 1 |
| `assignment_stratum` (Rajasthan) | district, Panchayat Samiti, and caste category joined with explicit separators | no component may be missing |
| `*_std` | ASCII transliteration, lowercase, punctuation replaced by spaces, and collapsed whitespace | unit tests cover punctuation, accents, whitespace, and missing values |
| `canonical_district_std`, `canonical_block_std` | exact PAI group or approved override | target exists in PAI and each left group is unique |
| `pai_available` | true exactly when a linked PAI Good Governance score is present | equality asserted by the design validators |
| `an_women_reserved` (UP) | 1 only when the 2021 reservation label explicitly identifies a women's category | values are exactly 0 and 1; winner sex is never used |
| `assignment_stratum` (UP) | canonical district, LGD block, and caste-reservation class | no component may be missing |
| `raw_lgd_gp_code` (UP) | exact-name or reviewed preclink link from the canonical election release | accepted links are one to one |

No missing value is replaced with zero. The pipeline stops when source row counts, key
cardinality, treatment levels, or crosswalk targets differ from these contracts.

## Mumbai (BMC) fields

One row in `data/bmc/quota_unquote_bmc_2007_2017.parquet` is one ward observed in one Praja survey wave: 1,361 rows, 227 wards in each of six waves (226 in 2014). Seat reservation is joined from `local_reservations` on council and ward number; every ward-wave matches exactly one seat.

### Join contract, Mumbai

- Left table: the Praja ward-wave table (1,361 rows). Right table: 681 seat rows, one per council and ward. The join must return every left row exactly once.
- Treatment counts per council: 76 (2007), 115 (2012, one more than the statute; ward 172 is disputed with the deposit), 114 (2017).
- The primary sample takes one wave per council (2011, 2016, 2018): 681 rows.
